Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my 100-day journey with the Python course by Dr. Angela Yu. My name is Uditi Parmar, and I am a passionate learner who is eager to dive deeper into the world of programming with Python.

I have decided to embark on this journey to not only improve my skills in the language but to also learn about the various applications of Python in the field of data science, machine learning, and web development. I believe that with the right guidance, effort, and dedication, anyone can master Python, and I am no exception.

The course by Dr. Angela Yu is renowned for its comprehensive and engaging approach to teaching Python. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics from the basics of programming to advanced topics such as web development, machine learning, and data visualization.
I will be sharing my journey through this course.
